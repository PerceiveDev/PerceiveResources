# Templates
A project template can be found [here](https://www.github.com/PerceiveDev/PerceivePluginArchetype), or [here](https://www.github.com/PerceiveDev/PerceiveProject) if you want a non-magical template.

A `.gitignore` template can be found in this folder, along with the team's formatter profile for Eclipse. *An IntelliJ formatter profile will be added shortly.*
